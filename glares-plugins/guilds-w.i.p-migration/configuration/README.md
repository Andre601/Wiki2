# Configuration

When the plugin starts up for the first time, the following files will be generated:

* [buff.yml](buffs.md)
* [config.yml](config.md)
* [roles.yml](roles.md)
* [tiers.yml](tiers.md)

The configuration for the plugin is split up into multiple files due to how flexible the plugin is and how much custom data you can add to it.
